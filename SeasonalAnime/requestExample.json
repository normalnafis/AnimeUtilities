      "synopsis": "Denji is robbed of a normal teenage life, left with nothing but his deadbeat father's overwhelming debt. His only companion is his pet, the chainsaw devil Pochita, with whom he slays devils for money that inevitably ends up in the yakuza's pockets. All Denji can do is dream of a good, simple life: one with delicious food and a beautiful girlfriend by his side. But an act of greedy betrayal by the yakuza leads to Denji's brutal, untimely death, crushing all hope of him ever achieving happiness.\n\nRemarkably, an old contract allows Pochita to merge with the deceased Denji and bestow devil powers on him, changing him into a hybrid able to transform his body parts into chainsaws. Because Denji's new abilities pose a significant risk to society, the Public Safety Bureau's elite devil hunter Makima takes him in, letting him live as long as he obeys her command. Guided by the promise of a content life alongside an attractive woman, Denji devotes everything and fights with all his might to make his naive dreams a reality.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To investigate Ostanian politician Donovan Desmond, Anya must either befriend his son Damian or collect eight Stella Stars to become an Imperial Scholar. Fortunately, Anya has already acquired her first star. In celebration, her adoptive father, Loid, decides to fulfill her wish to adopt a dog.\n\nDuring their canine search, Loid receives new orders from his superiors, who have found that a band of Berlint University students is plotting to assassinate Westalis' Minister Brantz using bombs worn by trained dogs. While Loid tries to stop their plans, Anya stumbles upon the terrorists' base of operations. There, she befriends a kindhearted, clairvoyant dog who the family later names Bond.\n\nAlthough the Forgers continue to lead their individual lives in secrecy, the family—with a new fluffy addition—remains united through all of the unusual obstacles thrown their way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This organized criminal group poses an immense threat to the Hero Association, not only because of its sheer size and strength, but also the overpowering quirks of Jin \"Twice\" Bubaigawara and Gigantomachia.\n\nAs new intel from the covert hero Keigo \"Hawks\" Takami confirms that Shigaraki is nowhere to be seen, the Hero Association decides to strike the enemy headquarters with a surprise attack using the entirety of its assets—and the UA students find themselves on the battlefield once again. As the fight rages on, the unsuspecting villains must regroup and push back, but the brave heroes are determined to eradicate every last one of them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Ichigo carries out his quest with his closest allies: Orihime Inoue, his childhood friend with a talent for healing; Yasutora Sado, his high school classmate with superhuman strength; and Uryuu Ishida, Ichigo's Quincy rival.\n\nIchigo's vigilante routine is disrupted by the sudden appearance of Asguiaro Ebern, a dangerous Arrancar who heralds the return of Yhwach, an ancient Quincy king. Yhwach seeks to reignite the historic blood feud between Soul Reaper and Quincy, and he sets his sights on erasing both the human world and the Soul Society for good.\n\nYhwach launches a two-pronged invasion into both the Soul Society and Hueco Mundo, the home of Hollows and Arrancar. In retaliation, Ichigo and his friends must fight alongside old allies and enemies alike to end Yhwach's campaign of carnage before the world itself comes to an end.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

      "synopsis": "Yoichi Isagi was mere moments away from scoring a goal that would have sent his high school soccer team to the nationals, but a split-second decision to pass the ball to his teammate cost him that reality. Bitter, confused, and disappointed, Isagi wonders if the outcome would have been different had he not made the pass. When the young striker returns home, an invitation from the Japan Football Union awaits him. Through an arbitrary and biased decision-making process, Isagi is one of three hundred U-18 strikers selected for a controversial project named Blue Lock. \n\nThe project's ultimate goal is to turn one of the selected players into the star striker for the Japanese national team. To find the best participant, each diamond in the rough must compete against others through a series of solo and team competitions to rise to the top. Putting aside his ethical objections to the project, Isagi feels compelled to fight his way to the top, even if it means ruthlessly crushing the dreams of 299 aspiring young strikers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

      "synopsis": "For as long as he can remember, Minoru Kagenou has been fixated on becoming as strong as possible, which has led him to undertake all kinds of rigorous training. This wish, however, does not stem from a desire to be recognized by others; rather, Minoru does everything he can to blend in with the crowd. So, while pretending to be a completely average student during the day, he arms himself with a crowbar and ruthlessly thrashes local biker gangs at night. Yet when Minoru finds himself in a truck accident, his ambitions seemingly come to a sudden end. In his final moments, he laments his powerlessness—no matter how much he trained, there was nothing he could do to overcome his human limitations.\n\nBut instead of dying, Minoru reawakens as Cid, the second child of the noble Kagenou family, in another world—one where magic is commonplace. With the power he so desired finally within his grasp, he dons the moniker \"Shadow\" and establishes Shadow Garden: a group whose sole purpose is to combat the enigmatic Cult of Diablos, an organization born from Cid's imagination. However, as Shadow Garden grows in both membership and influence, it becomes increasingly apparent that the Cult of Diablos is not as fictional as Cid had intended.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, instead of attacking Fushi in isolation, Nokkers begin targeting the settlements outside of his reach in hopes of luring him out. Soon, a group known as the Guardians—led by Hisame, the descendant of the deceased warrior Hayase—finds Fushi.\n\nInspired by how Fushi protected Janada Island from the Nokkers years ago, the Guardians have grown a considerable following and are recognized throughout the world. Initially reluctant, Fushi allows the Guardians to accompany him to the site of the Nokkers' recent attack. In their village, Fushi meets a few valuable allies, both new and old. But as the conflict with the Nokkers only leads to more loss, Fushi must find the inner strength to face his inevitable sorrow.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With his power of telekinesis, he moves around this new world, acquiring several skills and abilities. When the sword comes upon a forest filled with monsters, he meets a young girl fleeing from a beast. Grabbing the sword, the girl easily defeats the monster. After introducing herself as Fran, she names the sword \"Shishou\" and officially becomes his wielder.\n\nThe two set out to become adventurers, but unfortunately for Fran, she is a member of the Black Cat Tribe—a Beastkin group with a bad reputation. No member of this tribe has ever evolved into a mightier beast, but Fran plans to be the first and achieve her parents' dream. As Shishou promises to remain her sword until she attains her goal, they form an unstoppable partnership of impressive strength.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Thus, he hopes to be paired with her for the \"marriage practical\": their school's practice of randomly selecting boy-girl pairs to live as pretend married couples while monitoring and rating them on how close they have gotten. Meanwhile, the lively Akari Watanabe wants to be assigned to her crush, the popular and good-looking Minami Tenjin.\n\nMuch to their dismay, Jirou and Akari find out that not only have they been paired together, but so have Shiori and Minami! Determined to be with their crushes, Jirou and Akari strive to earn as many points as possible, as the top 10 pairs earn the right to switch their partners—so long as both couples agree.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Soon after, Bocchi meets her final bandmate—the cool bassist Ryou Yamada. \n\nAlthough their first performance together is subpar, the girls feel empowered by their shared love for music, and they are soon rejoined by Kita.

      "synopsis": "When aliens known as the Oni threaten to invade the Earth, they promise to leave under one condition—a randomly-chosen human must win a one-on-one game of tag against Lum, the beautiful daughter of the Oni leader. The \"lucky\" person selected happens to be the lustful and unlucky high schooler Ataru Moroboshi. Given 10 days to attempt to grab Lum's horns, Ataru realizes how impossible the challenge is as he is faced with Lum's extraterrestrial powers.\n\nMotivated by a promise of marriage from his childhood friend Shinobu Miyake, Ataru manages to catch Lum off guard. He mistakenly grabs hold of her bikini top first, but he eventually achieves his true goal. Although the game is over, Lum misunderstands that she is the one whom Ataru wants to marry, and she decides to move in with him. The poor student constantly tries to shake off the clingy Lum while doing his best to reconcile with his desired fiancée. After Ataru's heroic feat results in such a disastrous outcome, it is questionable whether luck will ever be on his side.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

What awaits them is not only adoration and admiration but also the shocking revelation that, in order to stay in the luxurious Royal One classroom, the entire class must be promoted to Dalet rank before entering the second year.\n\nAs the Harvest and Music Festivals are right around the corner, there seem to be ample opportunities to rank up. Doing so will not be simple, however, as no class thus far has managed to accomplish such a feat. Hoping to give the misfit class a chance to achieve the improbable, the school appoints special tutors to aid in confronting the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nWith his sights set beyond Dalet, Iruma Suzuki decides to take strides toward the goal of ranking up, starting with gaining acknowledgement from his special tutor: the short-tempered and selfish Bachiko Barbatos.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Kousetsu constantly follows and observes him with no regard for his privacy, focusing only on keeping him safe every waking moment. But the consistent hounding starts making sense when an adorable second-year student at his high school, Satomi Tsubaki, asks Ittoki out on a date. Though initially innocent, Tsubaki's true intentions soon become apparent when Ittoki visits her house; she plans to assassinate him, and she is not alone. Surprisingly, the ones who come to his aid are his uncle and Kousetsu—donning their dark and deadly ninja attire. \n\nAfter Ittoki is escorted to safety, his mother reveals the truth: he is the 19th heir to a noble clan of ninjas known as the Iga, and the target of assassination by their rival clan, the Koga. In order to protect himself against this new threat, Ittoki must hone his skills at the only ninja academy remaining in Japan: the Kokuten Ninja Academy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As such, many humans covet their abilities, leading some of these species to the brink of extinction.\n\nAs a beast tamer, Rein Shroud can employ the assistance of various animals for many tasks, such as reconnaissance and logistics. By virtue of his ability, he joins a party led by the vile and manipulative hero Arios Orlando, only to be banished after six months due to his uselessness as a non-combative class.\n\nHowever, unbeknownst to the team that cast him away, Rein is an exception among beast tamers. His potential becomes apparent when he meets Kanade—a cat spirit who is also one of the ultimate species—and is able to form a contract with her. With Kanade by his side, Rein sets out on his journey as an adventurer, steadily rising up the ranks and meeting more ultimate species along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The event triggers Aileen's memories from her past life—she has been reincarnated in an otome game as the villainess, who is destined to die in the final act. To prevent her predetermined demise, Aileen has only one option: to court the game's last boss, Claude Jeanne Elmir—the proclaimed \"Demon King\" and Cedric's half-brother—and marry him.\n\nHowever, it is easier said than done, as Claude distrusts her intentions. Instead of giving up, Aileen adamantly tries to win his heart by helping Claude fulfill his wish: to build peace between humankind and demonic beasts. But time is running out, and it is up to Aileen to change the course of not only her tragic ending but Claude's as well.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

      "synopsis": "The innocent Nagomi Wahira has always admired the cute girls serving at maid cafes. Hoping to fulfill her dream of becoming one, she moves to Akihabara to work at the maid cafe Ton Tokoton.\n\nNagomi's first day seems completely normal—until she has to run an \"errand\" at a rival maid cafe along with her fellow recruit, the mature Ranko Mannen. There, things quickly go south, and Nagomi soon gets her first taste of Akihabara's violent maid wars. As she watches Ranko calmly battle her way through a horde of gun- and knife-wielding maids, Nagomi realizes that maid cafes are drastically unlike what she had envisioned.\n\nWhile struggling to reconcile her expectations with the harsh reality she finds herself in, Nagomi searches for the enjoyment she once saw in the lives of maids.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As a result, schools have begun incorporating these technologies into their curriculum, leaving behind the ways of the old. One such institution is the elite Yuyu Girls' Vocational High School, where both Serufu Yua and her childhood friend, Miku \"Purin\" Suride, have applied. Although the tech-savvy Purin is accepted to Yuyu High, the accident-prone Serufu is rejected and enters the traditional Gatagata Girls' High School instead, driving a wedge into their friendship.\n\nOn her way to class one day, Serufu gets into a bike accident, and Rei Yasaku, a passerby who attends the same school, fixes her damaged bicycle. Serufu later finds out that Rei has a passion for old-fashioned crafts and is the head of the school's Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Club—which is in danger of closing due to a lack of members.\n\nRealizing that this may be her chance to repair her relationship with Purin, Serufu joins the club in hopes of creating projects that could bring them together once more. As the DIY Club welcomes new faces, Serufu learns to build not only handicrafts but also new friendships along the way!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

There, right and wrong are determined through duels between students, and the top-ranking duelist will receive Miorine Rembran as their fiancée—this prize being decided by Miorine's father.\n\nWhen Guel Jeturk, the best pilot in school and Miorine's current fiancé, demands that his betrothed move in with him, Suletta disapproves, so Guel challenges her. Although she emerges as champion, Suletta is subsequently detained on suspicion of piloting a forbidden type of mobile suit—a GUND-ARM, or \"Gundam\"—which results in her victory being voided.\n\nMiorine refuses to accept any more injustices and proposes another duel with even higher stakes.

On his way to school, he encounters Aoi Izumisawa, Bai Mongfa, Karin Istel, Amelia Irving, and Ilya Ilyukhin. Despite meeting them for the first time, Asahi suddenly receives love confessions from all of them at the end of the same day, perfectly aligning with the fortune teller's prediction.\n\nAs if that was not enough, Asahi soon learns that these five individuals are actually candidates to become his bride, and they have been invited by his father to live at Asahi's home. Left with no other choice, he reluctantly allows them to stay, resulting in a bawdy turn of events that brightens up his average high school life.\n\nHowever, as Asahi spends more time with them, forgotten memories gradually resurface. While uncovering the hidden truth, Asahi begins to believe that his fate with these potential partners might be more than just mere coincidence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Therefore, the majority of the people, in order to escape those natural disasters, came to live in mobile cities developed over the years. The Originium left behind at the site of such Catastrophes, has led to the rapid progress of civilization due to their immense energy. But it also brought something else with it — an incurable disease called Oripathy.\n\nBecause the bodies of those with Oripathy gradually crystalize and become a new source of infection at the time of death, in many countries, the Infected are subject to persecution under regimes of segregation and forced labor. Those who were oppressed by the governments are starting to rebel. Rhodes Island, a pharmaceutical company researching a cure for Oripathy, takes up their arms and starts a conquest trying to save all the people from the disease.\n\n(Source: Official Site, translated, edited)",

      "synopsis": "Among the royal court, there is an individual feared as much as revered: the Raven Consort Liu Shouxue. Residing in her jet-black palace and isolated from the emperor, she is the subject of countless rumors. Claimed to possess mystic abilities, she is said to take on any request—from finding lost items to inflicting curses. While some call her an immortal sage, others believe her to be a terrifying revenant. But such comments fail to faze Liu Shouxue, who prefers to spend her days in quiet solitude. That is, until the emperor, Xia Gaojun, barges into her court and asks for her assistance with a mysterious case.\n\nThe young emperor's request requires Liu Shouxue to step out of her palace for the first time. Despite Xia Gaojun's frequent visits annoying her to no end, she cannot bring herself to turn him away. Her predecessor's teachings echo in her ears: the Raven Consort is destined to remain forever alone and never desire anything. Yet Liu Shouxue finds herself making the first of several bonds when she asks Jiujiu, an innocently inquisitive court girl, to be her sole attendant.\n\nTogether, they begin fulfilling requests from the people of the palace. However, unknown perils lurk in the outside world, and drawing attention to herself may bring Liu Shouxue face-to-face with a past that is better left undisturbed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
